**Introduction**

Bike-sharing systems play a significant role in urban mobility. This analysis leverages Python for data processing and prepares the dataset for visualization in Tableau. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights about bike rentals in London.

**Data Understanding**

The dataset, london_merged.csv, contains 17,414 rows and 10 columns:

  time: Timestamp of the record.
  
  count: Number of bikes rented.
  
  real_tempature: Actual temperature in Celsius.
  
  feels_like_tempature: Perceived temperature in Celsius.
  
  humidity_percent: Humidity level as a percentage.
  
  wind_speed_kph: Wind speed in km/h.
  
  weather: Weather conditions (e.g., Clear, Rain, etc.).
  
  is_holiday: Whether the day is a holiday (0: No, 1: Yes).
  
  is_weekend: Whether the day is a weekend (0: No, 1: Yes).
  
  season: Meteorological season (e.g., Winter, Summer, etc.).
  
**Data Preparation**

Key steps taken to prepare the data:

1. Renaming Columns: Improved readability by renaming columns to more descriptive names.
2. Value Scaling: Converted humidity_percent to a scale between 0 and 1.
3. Mapping Values:
  Seasons (e.g., 3.0 â†’ Winter).

  Weather conditions (e.g., 1.0 â†’ Clear).
5. Data Type Conversion: Updated season and weather columns to string for proper mapping.
6. Statistical Summary: Generated descriptive statistics to understand the dataset's key metrics.
7. NULL Value Check: Confirmed there are no missing values.
   
**Insights and Observations**

Average Rentals: 1,143 bikes rented daily, with significant fluctuations (std: 1,085).
- Temperature Range: From -1.5Â°C to 34Â°C, representing all seasons.
- Humidity Impact: High average humidity (72.3%), potentially influencing bike rentals.
- Rental Patterns:
    Holidays: Rare in the dataset (~2% of days).
    Weekends: Comprise ~28% of the dataset.
- Peak Rentals: Maximum daily rentals reached 7,860, indicating high demand on busy days.
  
**Next Steps**
  
Visualization: The data has been saved as an Excel file (london_bikes_sharing_analysis.xlsx) for further visualization and exploration in Tableau.

You can view the interactive Tableau dashboard here: [Tableau Public Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/LondonBikeSharingDashboard_17365424694300/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Forecasting: Implement machine learning models to forecast bike rentals based on weather and temporal patterns.

**Tools Used**

Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib for data processing.

Tableau: For interactive visualizations.
